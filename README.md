# Agent-AI-hackathpon
My project for the hackathon with the help of AI agents
ðŸŽ¯ The problem statement is as Follows:
As a student your task is to develop a AI-powered code debugger using AI agents.
We know that Ai agents are powerful enough to create the code but the true talent lies here when we solve the issues that the agent Ai made debugger fails to recognize.Hence it's quite important to have physical involvement and inspection in the code creation for better results
